    <p>A Czech interpretation of the crepe. Slightly thicker than a French-style crepe, so they tend to be a little more filling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>Â½ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons strawberry jam, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer, adding more milk if needed, until smooth and thinner than a cake batter. Whisk in melted butter until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Pour a large ladleful of batter into the middle of the skillet; swirl around the skillet to coat the bottom. Cook until the bottom of crepe is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crepe; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Lay crepes flat and top with strawberries, yogurt, jam, honey, and cinnamon sugar. Roll crepes into logs and serve with whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
